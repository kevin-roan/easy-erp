### Signup Process
After sucessfull signup with auth0 the user should create an account where they would
be asked for
    1. User Name , email (Screen 1)
    2. Create a workspace (WorkspaceName,Participants[]) (Screen 2)
    3. Create a team in that workspace (TeamName,TeamType) (Screen 3)

All there data shall sent to the api; `api/v1/sign-up`

Later on the controller will create a new user profile, workspace collection and team collection.

@1. Create a user profile
  With the username and useremail create a new user doc. upon creating it should return the 
  userId to the controller, 
@2. Create a workspace with that id.
  With the userId and workspacename,particiapts list create a workspace where the owner id userId.
  It should return the workspaceId back to the controller.
@3. Create team in that workspace, with workspaceId
  TeamName, and TeamType can be used create a new team with all the details including the workspaceName
  and || or workspaceId.


After the signup process,the user can again create workspaces, teams as much as they want, 
but for that need use different api endpoints like, /workspace , /team etc.

PROS:

  1. Reduced api calls (faster signup process)
  2. Less complex than using nested api calls and waiting for params like workspaceId, and workspaceName.
