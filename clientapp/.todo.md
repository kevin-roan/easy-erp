<!-- -- Users should accept the tasks from the application -->
<!-- now the view tasks function fetches all the data, and the accepttaskcard is a child component, now when the user clicks on the accept -->
<!-- task card button (accpet now ) it should return a callback funciotn that has the id of the object as an argument. -->

<!-- -- need to create a place where i can handle all the logic from the client react native application, -->

## Step one

1. I need to create a store and reducer that asynchronously fetches the data when the user logs in to the app and store the state into
   async storage for offline usage ( completed ),
   now,
   if the device has an internet connection, fetch the data from the thunk middleware, if there is no internet, use the async storage instead.

<!-- 2. In the same way, when the user creates an account and logs in to the application for the first time, it should trigger a function, -->
<!--    that checks for device tockens for on the database, if there is no token available, it should upload the device unique token to the db. -->

3. Stored the data inside the async storage, but how to update the tasks ?

// write a thunk middleware that updates the db using axios.patch(), [completed]
// dispatch that middlware with the id of the task. from the accept task [completed]
