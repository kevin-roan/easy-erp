## Step one

1. I need to create a store and reducer that asynchronously fetches the data when the user logs in to the app and store the state into
   async storage for offline usage.

<!-- 2. In the same way, when the user creates an account and logs in to the application for the first time, it should trigger a function, -->
<!--    that checks for device tockens for on the database, if there is no token available, it should upload the device unique token to the db. -->
